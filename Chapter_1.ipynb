    "**Weights**, $w_1,w_2,…,$ are real numbers expressing the importance of the respective inputs to the output. A higher weight means that an input matters more.

    "The second layer of perceptrons is making a decision by weighing up the results from the first layer of decision-making. In this way a perceptron in the second layer can make a decision at a more complex and more abstract level than perceptrons in the first layer.\n",

    "A many-layer network of perceptrons can engage in sophisticated decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write $\\Sigma_j w_j x_j$ as a dot product, $w \\cdot x \\equiv \\Sigma_j w_j x_j$ where w and x are vectors of the weights and inputs, respectively. We can also move the threshold to the other side of the inequality and rename it as the perceptron's bias, $b \\equiv -threshold$\n",
